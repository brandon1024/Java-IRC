 *Serializable Command Message object that is transmitted by TCP between client 
 *applications through a dedicated server interface.
 *<p>
 *A Command Message object contains an integer representing the command code, a 
 *String object representing an associated message, a timestamp, a sender, and
 *an identification number.
 *<p>
 *Commands are used by the client and server applications to describe specific actions
 *and handle special cases. For instance, commands are used for orderly connection
 *release, version requests, server messages, defining client usernames, and retrieving
 *list of users connected to the server.
