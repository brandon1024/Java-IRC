 *<p>
 *The TransportEntity class defines an object that has the necessary fields to
 *be used as a way of communication between the client and server applications.
 *Each object communicated through the client and server must extend this class.
 *Objects that do not extend this class will be ignored, and could result in
 *the connection being aborted.
 *<p>
 *Each TransportEntity must have a sender identifier. This identifier can be any string
 *that identifies the issuer of the object to other clients connected to the server. A simple
 *username will suffice.
 *<p>
 *Each TransportEntity must have a sender identification key. This key must be unique
 *among all clients connected to the server, with the exception of the client and server
 *who have a sender ID of 0. Typically, the sender ID is a 256-bit alphanumeric key.
 *<p>
 *Each TransportEntity must have a timestamp identifying when the object was created.
 *This is handled by the TransportEntity constructor.
 *<p>
 *Finally, each TransportEntity must have an identification number. This number defines
 *how many TransportEntity objects have been created by the client or server during its
 *lifetime. This is handled by the TransportEntity constructor
